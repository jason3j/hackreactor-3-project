            Welcome to the About section of this project. Here I'll talk about each mini project that I did and how I
            accomplished all of them.  These projects were going to be sent you you at Hack Reactor individually but
            then I thought, "Why not link them all together into a type of portfolio?" Thanks to Bootstrap, I was able
            to make my project look even better that I thought possible.  You'll also see that I have used three
            different APIs for this project
        </p>
        <p>
            Main Page - The main page is what ties everything together. This page was where I really played a lot with
            Bootstrap and another API.  I thought the main page was too boring by itself so I decided to add the random
            number API so that every time you push the button or the page is loaded it shows a new random fact about a
            number.
        </p>
        <p>
            Poké Chart - This was the last and my favorite mini project that I worked on.  When I saw that there was
            an API for getting all data on any Pokémon I knew I had to use it.  I've loved Pokémon from a young age
            and it was fun to implement that into my project.  The most difficult part about this project was getting the
            correct data that I needed and knowing how to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yoda Talk - This was the first mini project that I worked on for this project.  It was also when I learned
            what an API is and how to use them.  I didn't find this project to be too difficult.  I just enjoyed
            the adventure of learning about the API technology.  I also learned to use spin.js in this project.

            If this page fails to return text to the bubble it is mostly likely due to the API unable to handle any
            requests at that time. It seems that the shorter the sentence the better the API can handle it.
            (An awesome API but free so it has its limitations)
        </p>

            Blackjack - This mini project is an adaptation to one that I sent you guys at Hack Reactor.  The version
            that I sent previously was only played with alert boxes and in the console.  It was really fun changing
            the code so you could see the cards on the web page as you played.  The project was difficult to make but
            was a blast at the same time.  It was nice to see my work displayed on the screen instead of the console.
            I guess the only thing I didn't like about this project was that I seem to lose to the dealer to much ;-)
